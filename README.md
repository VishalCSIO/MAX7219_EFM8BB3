## **To blink an eight 7-segment display using a MAX7219 driver with SPI communication on an EFM8BB3 Silicon Labs microcontroller**

The primary purpose of this file is to utilize a 7-segment display with driver in a range of industrial and consumer products that require a low-cost and efficeint microcontroller. 
EFM8BB31F64G-A-QFN32 operating up to 50 MHz in this family. The EFM8BB31F64G MCU is 8-bit which includes 64 kB of flash, 4.25KB of RAM, 12-bit ADC and others peripheral. 

### Discriptions::
The SPI communication protocol of the EFM8BB3 is utilized to control the MAX7219 display driver using three pins,which discuss below.
- SPI_MOSI   - DATA
- SPI_SCK    - CLK
- SPI_NSS    - CHIPSELECT

### Remaining Work:: 
Not included the alphabets yet to show on display.
